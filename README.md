# Self evaluation and course feedback


**Kornkanok Sangwichien N3570**

I am working with this project since the project have been start from the begining in Android research assignment. 
Firstly, we are interested to do game in kotlin which is Anna idea but we do not know yet about the game we are going to develop. 
Week 37-38, we are researching about the game idea. In week 39, we are discussing the idea we got then looking for technologies to implementing this game.
We usually meet at every Wednesday around 6-7 hours/day. We divided work into small pieces ,for example, function to do something then we integrated it together during our meeting.

From Mobile Project, we are continuing our android research assignment to Mobile Project. We are also still meet on every Wednesday but more on Thursday and some Monday.
I spending time on the project with every meeting usually because it is easier to communicate with co-worker. Also, sometime we using Discord(Application) to work online together.
I could say that I spending time on this project maybe around 50 hours more from week 40 if counting only from Mobile Project part.

My main work is programming in Kotlin. Also, presentation and some documentation. I did not work on Firebase.
I would give myself as a 5 for excellent work. I have done my best in this project.

We started the project for Android Research Assignment. We wanted to continue Mobile Research Assignment as Mobile Project but we changed our mind and decided to continue Android Research Assignment instead.

As Kornkanok said we were working every week during meetings or using Discord.

I was working on Firebase and algorithms for the game. I connected the project with Firebase and decided what data we want to save, read and how to use it in our game. I also created the basic algorithm to make the game work. For documentation I did part about Firebase, UML and explaining how the game works.
I worked really hard for this project, I've learned a lot of new things to make this project the best. I would give myself 5. We are proud of our game.

In the beginning i had the plan to continue the Mobile Application Development project. My group members told me, that they wanted to continue their Android project so i reconsidered and joined their team. So I was new to the whole thing and had to get into it. As before mentioned, we were working weekly on the project.
I was working on the menu,settings and I have made the background .png with a transparent sky that can be changed. So besides coding I worked with Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. I've made the Use Case Diagram and worked on the documentation. I would give myself a 4.
