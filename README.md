# Self evaluation and course feedback
**Kornkanok Sangwichien N3570**

I am working with this project since the project have been start from the begining in Android research assignment. 
Firstly, we are interested to do game in kotlin which is Anna idea but we do not know yet about the game we are going to develop. 
Week 37-38, we are researching about the game idea. In week 39, we are discussing the idea we got then looking for technologies to implementing this game.
We usually meet at every Wednesday around 6-7 hours/day. We divided work into small pieces ,for example, function to do something then we integrated it together during our meeting.

From Mobile Project, we are continueing our android research assignment to Mobile Project. We are also still meet on every Wednesday but more on Thursday and some Monday.
I spending time on the project with every meeting usually because it is easier to communicate with co-worker. Also, sometime we using Discord(Application) to work online together.
I could say that I spending time on this project maybe around 50 hours more from week 40 if counting only from Mobile Project part.
My main work is programming in Kotlin. Also, presentation and some documentation. I did not work on Firebase.
I would give myself as a 5 for excellent work. I have done my best in this project.
